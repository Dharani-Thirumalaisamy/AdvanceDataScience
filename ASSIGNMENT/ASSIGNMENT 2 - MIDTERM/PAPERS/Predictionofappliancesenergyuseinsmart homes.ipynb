    "The prediction of energy consumption in housing is very dependent on inhabitants’ behavior, so a stochastic method for prediction has been presented in this paper. Diffrent predicted have been prosed and tested in this paper. The data has been be segemented into k means clusters in order to improve the prediction precision. "
