    "This paper is about co-relation between energy consumption and the factors that influence that.It deals with a series of methods more precisely predictors to make predictions of the overall energy consumption of a household using the data collected over some months of a year.\n",
    "In the first section of the paper, the author has explained the various advantages of a good prediction model for electrical energy consumption and how the terms like Demand Side Management and Demand Side Response can be predicted on the basis of modelling.The energy consumption in domestic appliances is the main area of exploration where mainly two prameters are taken into account : the type and the number of appliances are used by the occupants of a house. Followed by a breif about the paper are the results and outputs of all the other similar papers and how these papers were able to perform a nearly accurate results are mentioned.Different approaches used by these papers, with the pros and cons of each method is also taken into account.The residential electrical energy consumption is explained via a pie chart of all the possible Appliances which contribute to energy consumption.\n"

    "In the second section , the author describes the house whose energy consumption will be predicted using various models, keeping in mind some other external factors. All the features like the appliances , occupants of the house, blueprints of the house with locations where various parameters are being calculated like Temperature and humidity and the daily routines of the house members is described. Also,about the ZigBee wireless sensors which is used to measure the temperature and humidity from different parts of the house.\n"

    "The third section of the paper deals with performing in detail analysis of the energy dataset. The recorded data and description includes features like EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), feature filtering, various regression models compared on the basis of different performance evaluation indices like MAPE ,RMSE, MAE, Model Selection etc.Histogram plots were plotted in which 0 shows no relation , -1 shows no co-relation and 1 means positive co-relation. The author used Boruta algorithm to discover which all parameters are important in this analysis but the result didn't come out as expected so they switched to Recursive Feature Elimination(RFE).After the analysis is made , the performance is evaluated with different performance indices out of which RMSE proves to be a better one. Among all the other regression types that were used in this analysis , GBM had good results for RMSE compared to other regression models.\n",

    "At the end , the authors concluded with the result that , few parameters such as humidity and temperature related to the house are associated with determining the use of energy of the appliances in the house . Similarly , parameters such as humidity , pressure etc also influence the energy consumption of the appliance .Other parameters which were considered in this study was eliminated using data filtering method."
